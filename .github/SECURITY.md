## Security Practices

We employ several security-first practices in the development and deployment of **YouTube-AI-Navigator-Browser-Extension**:

*   **Privacy-First Design:** The extension is designed with user privacy as a core principle. We avoid collecting unnecessary personal data and adhere to a zero-config philosophy where user privacy is paramount.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** A robust Content Security Policy is implemented to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks.
*   **Dependency Audits:** We regularly audit and update our third-party dependencies to ensure they are free from known vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Review:** All code changes undergo thorough peer review before being merged to identify potential security flaws.
*   **Minimal Permissions:** The extension requests only the minimum necessary permissions required for its functionality, following the principle of least privilege.
*   **Secure API Handling:** All interactions with external APIs, such as the Gemini API, are performed securely, minimizing exposure of sensitive data.

We are committed to continuous improvement of our security posture and appreciate the community's vigilance.
